riot_experiment
===============

Playing around with the Riot Developer APIs

To set this up, put the riot_experiment folder wherever your PHP server looks for documents to serve. From there, you can navigate to BASE_URL/riot_experiment/index.php. That will show the links to all of the other existing pages.

The cert folder includes the Riot API CA certificate for verifying that the request is hitting a valid server.
